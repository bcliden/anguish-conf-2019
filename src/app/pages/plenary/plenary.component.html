    <h2 class="title">Nathan K. Hensley</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Hensley is Associate Professor of English at Georgetown University, where he works on nineteenth-century British literature, critical theory, environmental humanities, and the novel. Other interests include Anglophone modernism and the cultures of globalization. His first book, <em>Forms of Empire: The Poetics of Victorian Sovereignty</em> (Oxford, 2016, paperback 2018), explores how Victorian writers expanded the capacities of literary form to account for the ongoing violence of liberal modernity.  A second project is about action, and ​draws on ecological thinking to understand how literary works imagine categories like will and personhood in the context of ​failing systems. With Philip Steer (Massey University, NZ), he has coedited​ a collection of essays, <em>Ecological Form: System and Aesthetics in the Age of Empire</em> (Fordham UP, forthcoming fall ​2018)​; and with Tommy Davis (Ohio State), he coedited a cluster on Modernism/Modernity's Print + platform called "Scale and Form; or what was Global Modernism" (2018). ​Hensley was born in Fresno, California, and holds degrees from Vassar College (B.A.), the University of Notre Dame (M.A.), and Duke (Ph.D), where he was also a Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellow. Before coming to Georgetown, he was assistant professor of English at Macalester College.</p>
